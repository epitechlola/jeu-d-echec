# chess-game

This is a Python project.
In this repository I will code a chess game using Pygame and Numpy. I provide all the visual content (chess pieces, chessboard) that is needed to play. It is playable on only one computer, so you need to be with your friend if you want to play with them.

this was my first python project. You can play by running the main.py file.
